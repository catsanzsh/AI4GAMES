AI4GAMES
Version: 1.0 > REQUEST TO UPLOAD 2.8.25

Overview
AI4GAMES is an experimental, open-source project that integrates advanced artificial intelligence techniques into game development. The goal is to create dynamic, responsive game environments powered by cutting-edge AI models while maintaining a modular design that’s easy to extend. This README provides a comprehensive guide—including M1 Mac–specific instructions—to help you set up, build, and run the project.

Features
Advanced AI Integration: Enhance game logic and behavior with state-of-the-art AI.
Modular Architecture: Easily extend or customize components for your game.
Cross-Platform Support: Designed to work on various platforms with special considerations for M1 Macs.
Future-Ready: Planned integration with popular game engines (such as Unity) and support for C#/.NET development on Apple Silicon.
Requirements
Operating System: macOS 12 or later (macOS Ventura or later is recommended for best performance on M1 Macs)
Hardware: Apple Silicon (M1) Mac
Development Tools:
Xcode Command Line Tools
bash
Copy
xcode-select --install
Homebrew (for package management) – Install Homebrew
(For Unity Projects) Unity 2020.3 or later (Unity 2021+ has native Apple Silicon support)
(For C# Projects) .NET SDK (preferably the ARM64 version)
(For Python Components) Python 3.10+ and pip
Installation
1. Clone the Repository
Open your terminal and run:

bash
Copy
git clone https://github.com/catsanzsh/AI4GAMES.git
cd AI4GAMES
2. Set Up the Development Environment
Depending on your project’s primary language and toolchain, follow the appropriate steps below:

For Unity Projects
Open the Project in Unity Hub:
Ensure you select a Unity version that supports Apple Silicon (2021 or later recommended).
Configure Build Settings:
Adjust settings as needed for your target platform (macOS).
For C#/.NET Projects
Open the Solution:
Use Visual Studio for Mac or Visual Studio Code.
Restore Dependencies and Build:
Run the following from the project folder:
bash
Copy
dotnet restore
dotnet build
dotnet run
For Python-Based Components
If your project uses Python tools or scripts:

Create a Virtual Environment:
bash
Copy
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
Install Dependencies:
bash
Copy
pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the Application:
bash
Copy
python main.py
3. M1 Mac Specific Setup
Rosetta 2 (Optional):
For any tools not yet optimized for Apple Silicon, install Rosetta 2:
bash
Copy
/usr/sbin/softwareupdate --install-rosetta --agree-to-license
Unity on Apple Silicon:
If you’re using Unity, confirm you are running a version with native M1 support. Check Unity’s release notes if needed.
.NET SDK for ARM64:
Download and install the ARM64 version of the .NET SDK from Microsoft’s official website if you plan to build C# projects.
Usage
Running the Project:
For Unity: Open the project in Unity Hub and press the Play button.
For .NET/C#: Use dotnet run as shown above.
For Python: Execute the main script after activating your virtual environment.
Documentation:
Further documentation and usage examples will be added as the project evolves. In the meantime, check the sample scripts and project structure for guidance.
